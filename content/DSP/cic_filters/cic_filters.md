title: Cascaded integrator–comb (CIC) filters
date: 2018/10/14
description: CIC filters are computationally efficient implementations of narrowband lowpass filters. They are particularly suited for use as an anti-aliasing filter when decimating or an anti-image filter when interpolating. CIC filters are well suited for implementation in FPGAs and ASICs as they only require addition and subtraction operations and not multiplication.
